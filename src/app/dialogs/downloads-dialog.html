    Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A or DwCA) is a biodiversity informatics data standard that makes use of the Darwin Core terms to produce a single, self-contained dataset for species occurrence or checklist data. See TDWG's <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/index.htm" target="_blank">Darwin Core introduction</a> for a more detailed description.

    In this case, the files contain the specimen and multimedia data of the collection specified in it's name, with the exception of the 'nsr' file, which contains names, taxonomy and occurrence status for all the species from the <a href="http://www.nederlandsesoorten.nl/content/english" target="_blank">Dutch Species Register</a>.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    The files listed below are generated weekly. The date part of the filename reflects the moment the file was generated, and does not hold any relation to the date the data was entered into the NBA, or the date the original data was created.
